In the paper, an immediate conclusion is made that H1 could be confirmed, but the statistically significant reasoning/calculations for this is missing. For efficiency, another hasty conclusion is made based on the results, although here, the difference is very apparent upon looking, so their word can be taken for it. For H3, another quick conclusion is drawn that users were more satisfied by 2D than VR, which based on the results, is also hard to tell whether the difference is statistically significant.
